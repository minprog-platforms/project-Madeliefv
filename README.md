# Abstract
During this project I am aiming to create a Agent Based Model of a tumor and it's treatment.
The agents in this project will be:
- cancer stem cells
- cancer transitory cells
- chemotherapy molecules

With this model I would like to awnser the research question. What is the effect of the size of the tumor and the concentration of chemotherapy on the eredication of it. 


# what will the model look like
what will the model look like:
- one can chose the start size of the tumor
- one can chose the concentration of chemotherapy

## short theory behind model
During mitosis, a stem cell can divide either asymmetrically or symmetrically. In asymmetric mitosis, one of the two daughter cells remains a stem cell, replacing its parent. So a stem cell effectively never dies - it is quasi reincarnated after each division. The other daughter cell turns into a transitory cell that moves outward.

Young transitory cells may divide, breeding other transitory cells. The transitory cells stop dividing at a certain age and eventually die. 

A stem cell may also divide symmetrically into two stem cells. This will be done with a chance of ....... Otherwise the stem cell will divide asymmetrically.

# Making it bigger 
Posibilities for enlarging the project:
- also adding the option of metastisis:
    * In this case there will be a chance that one of the stemcells comes loose and will migrate to a different part where it will form a new tumor
